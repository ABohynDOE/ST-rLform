# ST-rLform
Code for the implementation of a catalog generation algorithm in two steps:

  - **Extension**: extending a parent design into a candidate design by adding a column
  - **Reduction**: reducing the set of candidate designs into a minimum complete set
  
In this algorithm, the search-table mehtod is used for the extension step and the reduction step is done through the rL-form.
The rL-form is canonical form for reduced design matrix.

## Code files
This repository contains two folders with the implementation of the algorithm in *Python* and in *MATLAB*.
